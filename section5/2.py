#points variable is [(1, 2, 0), (2, 4, -1), (3, 6, -2), (4, 8, -3), (5, 10, -4)]
#it's a list of tuples combining elements of x_coor, y_coor, z_coor, 
#where elements of these lists with the same index are together in a tuple

#The rule of the zip function
#The zip function pairs elements with the same index 
#from multiple iterables into tuples
